Started off the experiment by getting all the required software.
Then I started the Heroku tutorial.
First I cloned the "java-getting-started" repository.
Then I created a Heroku app, deployed the code and played around with scaling (dynos).
I learned about viewing logs and adding a database as an addon.
Then i did some local running and changing, where i ultimately pushed the local changes to the cloud.
Lastly i played with some config vars and started a one-off dyno.

The steps were validated by testing the changes.

The only problems i encountered were caused by either missing environment variables or just not following the instructions correctly, which was corrected quickly.
